# Rupali's (F1) Motorsports Simulator

Here is a basic overview of the features available in this simulator:

1. Utilise Unsplash's API to determine the location of your grand prix based on your input (please add your own access key)
2. Generate your custom racetrack
3. Choose your team and verse Ferrari 55
   - Note that the input sound's amplitude determines the speed of the Ferrari, and the pitch determines the speed of your car. Use this to your advantage.
4. Utilise Peasy to change your perspective of the GP and never miss an overtake
